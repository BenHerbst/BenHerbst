## Tools I use

I use VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

I do all WebDev etc. in IntelliJ, but I sometimes use VS Code too, like with code spaces. 
Furthermore, I also used Neo vim in past but switched to something more powerful out of the box and IDE as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate ðŸ”¥ is, with also great database features etc. build in.
I also used both Scratch and Eclipse in the past.
I use GitHub Copilot and I enjoy itÂ ðŸ˜Š
I also recommend using Termius as SSH and SFTP client, it's a beautiful software!
I also use Postman for rest apis and Zenkit for project managmenet.
Diagrams.net and PlantUML for UML and visualation.
As version control, I use Git.
For Gamedev I primarily used Godot with Gdscript.
I am learning Figma and Django.

Used Fontforge in past to create own fonts. Gimp and Inkscape for design, Aseprite for Pixel Art, some Blender for 3D.
Virtual Box as VM.
