## Tools I recommend

I use Vim for simple scripts in terminal and Emacs for long coding sessions and Org mode.

I recommend **Gnome** for a **great out of the box Linux Desktop** experience.

Also use **Gruvbox dark** and **Pop!_OS dark** themes for your eyes.

Also take a look at **Pop!_OS** for large monitors and **Ubuntu**.

I suggest you to make experience with the Godot Game engine. Game developing is more than just code.

Don't build applications with electron shit.

Use Javafx, Qt or Gtk

If you do Java, use Jetbrains

I believe that it has **4 elements**:

1. Logic ( code; everything that gives the game a logic, so a figure can run, buttons popup windows, ... ; connects Graphics with Data and Audio )
2. Audio ( Sounds, Music; everything the player can hear )
3. Graphics ( e.g. Figures, Houses and everything else the player can see )
4. Data ( e.g. dialogues, items, ... )

**Please use Org Mode for your todo lists. It is amazing!**
