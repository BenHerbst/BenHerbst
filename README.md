## Tools I recommend

I use Vim for simple scripts in terminal and Neovim for long coding sessions and Kanboard.

I recommend **Gnome** for a **great out of the box Linux Desktop** experience.

Also use **Gruvbox dark** and **Pop!_OS dark** themes for your eyes.

Also take a look at **Pop!_OS** for best desktop OS.

I suggest you to make experience with the Godot Game engine. Game developing is more than just code.

Don't build applications with electron shit.

Use Javafx, Qt or Gtk, Electron is not recommended by me! Only for ( maybe ) some cases like email app.

If you do Java, use Intellij.


## Gamedev

I believe that it has **4 elements**:

1. Logic ( code; everything that gives the game a logic, so a figure can run, buttons popup windows, ... ; connects Graphics with Data and Audio )
2. Audio ( Sounds, Music; everything the player can hear )
3. Graphics ( e.g. Figures, Houses and everything else the player can see )
4. Data ( e.g. dialogues, items, ... )

**Please use Kanboard for your kanban boards / todolists. It is amazing!**
