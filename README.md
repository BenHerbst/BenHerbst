## Tools I recommend

I mainly use Vscode for my programming. Sometimes Intellij and Android Studio for Java.

I recommend **Cinnamon** for a **great out of the box Linux Desktop** experience.

Also use **Dark mode** for your eyes.

Also take a look at **Linux MInt** for overall best desktop OS.

I suggest you to make experience with the Godot Game engine for game development, Gtk for great Linux apps, Flutter for good cross platform apps

Don't build applications with electron, better use native stuff or atleast Flutter.

Use Javafx, Qt or Gtk, Electron is not recommended by me! Only for ( maybe ) some cases like Chat app.

If you do Java, use Intellij.


## Gamedev

I believe that it has **4 elements**:

1. Logic ( code; everything that gives the game a logic, so a figure can run, buttons popup windows, ... ; connects Graphics with Data and Audio )
2. Audio ( Sounds, Music; everything the player can hear )
3. Graphics ( e.g. Figures, Houses and everything else the player can see )
4. Data ( e.g. dialogues, items, ... )
