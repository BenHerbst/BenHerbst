I recommend **Plank dock**, **Herbstluftwm**, **Nitrogen** and **Polybar** for a **great Linux Desktop** experience.

Also take a look at **Manjaro** and **Arch**.

I suggest you to make experience with the Godot Game engine. Game developing is more than just code.

I believe that it has **4 elements**:

1. Logic ( code; everything that gives the game a logic, so a figure can run, buttons popup windows, ... ; connects Graphics with Data and Audio )
2. Audio ( Sounds, Music; everything the player can hear )
3. Graphics ( e.g. Figures, Houses and everything else the player can see )
4. Data ( e.g. dialogues, items, ... )
